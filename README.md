# Awesome IT jokes

A curated list of awesome IT jokes (videos, songs, articles, Github projects, Twitter accounts).

## Motivation

IT community usually creates new ["awesome-*something*"](https://github.com/search?q=awesome) repository for each new language or platform.
We love having a hand-picked list of exciting tools created since time immemorial.
Why? Just to share with a newbie or to choose something to play around with during the weekends.
Sadly up to now we forgot about the funny side of our work. 

There is a specific sense of humor, which probably could be understood only by true programmers. 
Artifacts of it are hidden all around the internet, in personal blogs or conferences' youtube channel.
The purpose of this repo is having them all in one place.

## Acceptance Criteria

Humour is a subjective thing, so any discussion about "was it _REALLY_ funny" in PRs are not allowed.
Feel free to contribute anything that obeys the following rules:

- #### Content should be created with one and only purpose - to make somebody smile
- #### Content should be about IT-specific topic or at least use IT terms

Serious tech-talk with a funny picture of cat on one slide in the middle won't be accepted.
Twitter account which accidentally published one funny meme about IT and then continue shit-posting won't be accepted.
