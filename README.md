# Awesome IT jokes

A curated list of awesome IT jokes (videos, songs, articles, Github projects, twitter accounts).

## Motivation

IT community usually creates new ["awesome-*something*"](https://github.com/search?q=awesome) repository for each new language or platform.
We love having highlighted list of exciting tools created during our history. 
Just to share with a newbie or choose something to play around during the weekends.
Sadly we forgot about the funny side of our work. 

There is a specific sense of humor, which probably could be understood only by true programmers. 
Artifacts of it are hidden all around the internet, in personal blogs or conferences youtube channel.
The purpose of this repo is storing all of them in one place.
Just to show new people that we can be funny and we usually do.

## Acceptance Criteria

Humour is a subjective thing, so any discussion about "was _REALLY_ it funny" in PRs are not allowed.
Feel free to contribute anything that corresponds with the following rules:

- #### Content should be created with the only purpose - make somebody smile
- #### Content should be about IT-specific topic or at least use IT terms

Serious tech-talk with a funny picture of cat on one slide in the middle won't be accepted.
Twitter account which accidentally published one funny meme about IT and then continue shit-posting won't be accepted.
